Advanced camera module and fast optical pulse generator (FIC3-FIL3)<br />

  The injector spray imaging device is able to take pictures of the fuel when it is sprayed<br />
  from the injector and send the captured images to the computer. The system software<br />
  processes the image and provides criteria for accepting or rejecting the produced injector.<br />

High Speed Imaging of the spraying of injectors, sprayers and sprayers is one of the most useful methods for evaluating the quality of spraying. Compared to other methods, this method has the following advantages: <br />
1- Very low cost compared to particle spectrometry methods<br />
2- High flexibility in terms of image capture speed, exposure speed and number of captured frames<br />
3- The possibility of detecting and analyzing non-spherical particles<br />
4- Relative insensitivity to optical properties of particles<br />
5- The possibility of extracting the speed of particles with repeated imaging<br />
6- Visual study of the shape of the spray and how it changes with time<br />
7- Insensitivity to multiple diffraction (unlike spectroscopic methods)<br />
Due to these features, high-speed spray imaging systems are very common.<br />
